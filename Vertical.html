                        <p class="card-text">Vertical farming is a type of indoor agriculture that involves growing
                            crops in
                            vertically stacked layers using various technologies like hydroponics, aeroponics, and

                            Smart
                            agriculture technology refers to the use of advanced tools and techniques to optimize

                            production, reduce waste, and increase efficiency. Vertical farming is a perfect fit for
                            smart
                            agriculture technology, as it allows for precise control over the growing environment, which

                                status. They also check the maturity of the crops by looking at the growth stage, fruit

                                    <p class="card-text">Hybrid modules use a combination of pre-fabricated modules and
                                        other structures, such as greenhouses or atriums, to create a customized growing
                                        environment. This type of modular farm is highly customizable and can be adapted
                                        to suit a wide range of growing conditions.</p>
